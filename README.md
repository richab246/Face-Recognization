# Face Recognition System using OpenCV

This project implements a Face Recognition System using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. The system detects and analyzes human faces in real-time, offering various functionalities for identification and authentication. It utilizes OpenCV's algorithms to detect facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. 

## Features
- Real-time face detection and tracking.
- Comparison of detected faces with a pre-existing database for identification.
- Facial feature extraction and analysis.
- Enhanced security for applications like surveillance and access control.
- Personalized user experiences based on facial recognition.
- Efficient biometric authentication using facial features.
- Facial expression analysis for emotion recognition.

## Getting Started
To run the Face Recognition System, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies, including OpenCV, on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Prepare a database of known faces for identification (images or video frames).
4. Configure the system parameters such as face detection threshold, recognition models, etc.
5. Run the main application script.
6. The system will automatically detect and analyze faces in real-time, providing relevant outputs.

## Configuration
The system provides configuration options in the `config.ini` file. Modify the settings to suit your requirements, including paths, thresholds, and model parameters.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
